# News-Category-Prediction
Data Science, Machine Learning,Deep learning

## Introduction:
      A machine learning and NLP-powered web application that predicts the category of a news article (e.g., World, Sports, Science and Technology, Business) based on its content.
Built with Python, scikit-learn, and Streamlit, this app allows users to input or upload text and instantly receive an accurate category prediction.
## Features:
     * Text preprocessing (tokenization, stopword removal, lemmatization)
     * Trained ML model and DL model for fast and reliable category prediction
     * Interactive and easy-to-use web interface
     * Supports custom text 
     * Visualizes model performance metrics
  ## Key Responsibilities & Achievements:
       • Collected and preprocessed a large corpus of news headlines for text classification using tokenization, stopword removal, and TF-IDF vectorization.
       • Trained and evaluated multiple models including Random Forest, Naïve Bayes, XGBoost, and LSTM for
          headline classification.
       • Achieved 90% accuracy with the Naïve Bayes model after hyperparameter tuning and feature optimization.
       • Integrated the optimized model into a Streamlit web app for real-time news category prediction.
       • Designed a user-friendly interface allowing users to input multiple headlines and view predicted categories
         instantly.
       • Visualized model performance and metrics using confusion matrices and accuracy plots for better
         interpretability.
  ## Highlights:
        • Best-performing model: Naïve Bayes (Accuracy: 90%)
        • Implemented hyperparameter tuning for optimal performance and generalization.
        • Delivered a fully functional end-to-end ML web app for text classification.
